# My-models
Here I deposit my models I have implemented on the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn. In the two published jupyter notebooks I represent my models based on SGDClassifier (fine-tuned to achieve the results as satisfying as the ones obtained using more sophisticated algorithms) and Multilayer Perceptron. I consider these as my sandbox, and I am going to exploit my skills to build models on real-world data in future.
